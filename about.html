                    National Institute of Technology Warangal, formerly known as Regional Engineering College, was
                    established in 1959. Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru laid the foundation stone for this institute on October
                    10, 1959, the first in the chain of 31 NITs (formerly known as RECs) in the country.<br><br>

                    curriculum, implementing innovative and effective teaching methodologies and focusing on the
                    wholesome development of the students are our concerns. Thanks to UNESCO and UK assistance in the
                    past, many developmental activities were undertaken. The World Bank Assistance under Technical
                    Education Quality Improvement Programme (TEQIP) had been a timely help in the overall development of
                    the Institute.<br><br>
